poetry is used on mac to manage the virtual environment and libraries, however on windows this does not work well.

A virtual environment is created using with [Virtual Environment Name] = demand-estimation:
python -m venv [Virtual Environment Name]
.\[Virtual Environment Folder Name]\Scripts\activate
.\demand-estimation\Scripts\activate
to deactivate:
(sample_venv) C:\Users\yoges\Python_venv> deactivate

libraries to install:

seaborn
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
